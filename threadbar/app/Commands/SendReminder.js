class SendReminder extends Command {
  //signature is the name by which the command will be called, but also the arguments
  //and extra parameters the command accepts.
  static get signature () {

  }
  //description is useful when we run ./ace --help. It shows what the command does
  //and describes what the arguments and parameters are for.
  static get description () {
    return 'Tell something helpful about this command'
  }
  //handle is where we put all the code this command needs to use. Weâ€™re going to use it
  //to send reminder e-mails to our customers, but for now it can log text to the console.
