/*
Itâ€™s not a huge improvement, but it is an interesting technique to be aware of. Hashbang directives (like this one) 
can be useful for hiding unnecessary details, such as the
binary we need to run a script, so that these kinds of stand-alone scripts are easier for
others to use

| The ace file is just a regular Javascript file but with no extension. You
| can call `node ace` followed by the command name and it just works.
|
| Also you can use `adonis` followed by the command name, since the adonis
| global proxy all the ace commands.
